Fork of caml_mongo by Kiyoto Tamura ( https://github.com/kiyoto/caml_mongo ).
New code is licensed under MIT license, see LICENSE_MIT.txt .

This fork uses Lwt at its core: to provide concurrent requests, iterate through cursors, etc.
It also implements some key mongo commands: authentication, runcommand, admincommand.

The code is functional but is considered alpha quality.
In particular, network failures are not checked.

  I am slowly writing an OCaml driver for MongoDB, mainly as
  a learning experience. Any feedback is appreciated, and the
  code is in the Public Domain.
  
  Right now, all I have is a bson de/serializer and a simple
  implementation of the Mongo Wire Protocol. The next logical
  step is to write a reasonabl interface so that the user can
  interact with the database without worrying about the
  underlying protocol. Also, I should add a test suite.
